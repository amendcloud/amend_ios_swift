[Getting started guide for iOS]

## Setup ######################################################################

amend iOS framework is available at [https://github.com/amendcloud/amend_ios_swift.git](https://github.com/amendcloud/amend_ios_swift.git)

### Manual setup

1. Go to [https://github.com/amendcloud/amend_ios_swift.git](https://github.com/amendcloud/amend_ios_swift.git) and download iOS library.
2. Library is a ZIP archive that could be extracted using any unzip tool.
3. Drag and Drop the framework into your project.

## Try it right away

Sign up for a [free account](http://developer.amendcloud.com/Register) so you can try out image transformations and seamless image delivery through CDN.

*Note: Replace `demo` in all the following examples with your amend's `amend name`.*  

Accessing an uploaded image with the `pc` public ID through a CDN:

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/pc.jpg

![Sample](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_300/pc.jpg "Sample")

Generating a 150x100 version of the `pc` image and downloading it through a CDN:

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/pc.jpg

![Sample 150x100](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/pc.jpg "Sample 150x100")

Converting to a 150x100 PNG with rounded corners of 25 pixels: 

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/r_25/pc.jpg

![Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/r_25/pc.jpg "Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG")

For plenty more transformation options, see our [image transformations documentation](http://amend.com/documentation/image_transformations).
 
## Usage

### Configuration

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `AmendName` parameter set. 
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads) must have the `AmendKey` and `AmendSecret` parameters set. 


Set the `AmendName`, `AmendKey` and `AmendSecret` values under the Amend dictionary of the Info.plist.

### Upload

Assuming you have your amend configuration parameters defined (`AmendName`, `AmendKey` and `AmendSecret`), uploading to amend is very simple.
    
The following example uploads a file to the cloud: 
    
    let amendObj = Amend()
    amendObj.initWithDelegate(Delegate: self, Image: self.imageViewOutlet.image!, RequestCode: 1 )
    amendObj.executeWithImageName(ImageName: "Name_of_Image")

 you can get ImageId return by amend upload api in 'didReceiveData' method

 	func didReceiveData(ImageId : NSString,RequestCode : Int){
     
    }

    func didfailedWithError(errorMessage : NSString,RequestCode : Int){
  
    }


	
### Embedding and transforming images

Any image uploaded to amend can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates the url for accessing an uploaded `pc` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle and set on ImageView ivResultImageView

	let amend = Amend()
    let amendOption = AmendOption()

    amendOption.transform(Width: 100, Height: 150, Fit: UIFitState.FIT_FILL)
    amend.getImage(ImageId: "pc", ImageView: self.ivResultImageView , Option : amendOption)


Another example, emedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail: 

	let amend = Amend()
    let amendOption = AmendOption()

    amendOption.transformFitFace(Height: 90, Width: 90)
    amend.getImage(ImageId: "pc", ImageView: self.ivResultImageView , Option : amendOption)
